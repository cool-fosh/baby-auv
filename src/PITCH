Rough approximation of how much to move the mass per degree of
pitch change.

Assume AUV is roughly level.  The vertical distance between CG
and CB is H, approximately 6mm.  The moving mass is 1/3 the
total AUV mass, => motion of CG = 1/3 motion of mass.

For pitch change of 1 sliv (= 1/256 of cicle), CG must move
sin(angle) * H = 0.15mm of CG movement
=> 0.15*3 = 0.45mm of mass movement.

At level position, assume servo arm is at right angles (should
be a good assumption unless we've badly trimmed the AUV).

The arm has radius approx 35mm.  0.45mm translates to an angle
of asin(0.45/35) = 0.74 degrees.  Full motion (corresponding to
200 units) is 120 degrees, so this is 0.74/120 = 0.0062 of full
scale.  Full scale is from -100 to 100, or 200 units.

Therefore 1 sliv of pitch requires approx 1.23 units of change
to mma_set().

5 degrees is about 3.5 slivs, or 4.4 units of change.
