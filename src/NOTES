Thruster PWM can hitchhike on any timer, so is not a concern.

Option 1: use timer1 for ppm and for uptime clock.
F_CPU is 8MHz.  Prescaler is /8, TOP is 20,000 (20ms).
ISR updates uptime clock every 20ms, and also sets the ppm
value.

SD card?  Should allow any other MCU (belonging to another
sensor for example) to log to card.  This suggests a separate
standalone MCU.  However we would like to READ the SD card on
startup also, to get our instructions.  That suggests the main
MCU should be in charge of the SD card.

If the main MCU is in charge of the SD card, then how to allow
orderly access to it?  We may have some free pins, twi? spi?
how?  Packetised?

Main MCU should broadcast vehicle state?  Over serial?

Broadcast only when at a mission point?

Logging MCU scenario
--------------------
Logger has multiple serial receivers, only 1 serial output.
How to serialise data?  Poll each sensor: float each pin high in
turn.  If a sensor has data, it pulls the pin low.  As long as
the pin is low, it can write.  If the pin is already low, then
it cannot write.

Positioning
-----------
GPS uses decimal minutes.
1 minute is about 1.85 km, 1 nautical mile.
1/256 of a minute is about 7.2m, which is appropriate
resolution.
1/1000 of a minute is also appropriate (milliminutes?)
21.6 million milliminutes.
32 bits is appropriate for this.

More on positioning:
1 mmn is 1.85m.
Normal GPS output has resolution 0.0001 minutes, or 0.18m
If we divide a circle into 2^26 parts, then 1 part is 0.596m,
which is good.
It is expecially convenient for arithmetic since we can just
mask off the upper 6 bits of a 32-bit value after every operation.

TODO: buzzer function?

Servo MG946R takes over 1A when buzzing.  Turn it off when not in use?
Requires another GPIO.

Using HK15138 servo, current draw is about 300-400mA at max, but
servo is not stiff at all.  This may make it unsuitable for use.
Also the shaft is plastic, not metal.  Rated at 4.3kg-cm, which
might be enough.

Logging: how to log changes in thruster and mma settings, which
can happen in an ISR.

At the moment, thruster settings are logged by sense() when
called.  But if it isn't called, then changes to thruster
settings will be lost.

- Call a housekeeping function periodically?
- Thruster routines can check the I bit: if cleared, it is
running inside an ISR and must not log.  Then the caller who set
up that ISR is responsible for logging.

It should be ok to only swop sectors at the entry points: e.g.
at entry to logg(), make sure it owns the sector.  If not, sync
and take it back.

Bug: sd_bread() returns data that does not exist on the card.
There is a fault in sd() somewhere.

Instead of making a circular buffer for queueing outgoing data,
why not use a regular file?  Most of the code for logging can be
used.  Only code to unlink sent data from the head.
